Over the past months, I've dedicated myself to studying composition techniques for photographers, and I'm incredibly proud to showcase the knowledge and skills I've gained.</p>
            <p class="scrolling">I've worked hard to master various composition techniques, from the rule of thirds to leading lines, and I'm eager to share my work with you all.</p>

                    <p>Here i treid to make sure that my understanding of the concept of thirds by setting the necesseary environment to achive the best photot from the best photo i could get. the result is relatively good, i would say.
                        i would like to explain the appreciation that i ahve to the benefit of this method.for example, its ability to present harmonious composotion, because it forces me to avoid the objects the objects that are in the center. it is sort of beautifule when you think about it. </p>

                        here i took photo that has the concepet of Repetiton and patterns. to be honest, this is one of the easiest images i took because of it relevance in the general public. in other words its cultural importance is ver obvious because most people consider patterns and repetition a very important part in process of learning. </p>
                    <figure>

                            i would also like to add the the color pallete that image has contribute to the repetitive appearance of the object present. i love this method because the visual flow is easy to maintain in comparison to other methods.</p>

                        here, if i remember, it took so many reconsiderations to fit the instructions. in the photo is a bowl of vegtabales taken from above. for me i think that if i rendered the quality of the photo using adobe. not to mention that the photo could be better if took a liitle closer. I would have looked more appealing.

                            But i wanted to explain some kind of a metaphor with the image at hand. i toook an inspiration from the old paintings of Vincent Van Gogh. The idea that the poor people in the old times, were working hard with a little to gain income.

                            in my opinion, an image that uses these method, makes a very stright forward point. By providing a representaion to the the simplistic and minimalistic desires we can consider having.

                            if there is anything i would upgrade and make the image better, is that if i could put a stronger emphasis on the selective focus and its position. specifically speaking, iwould have take an image from down the head of the animal to show the whin, i would say.
