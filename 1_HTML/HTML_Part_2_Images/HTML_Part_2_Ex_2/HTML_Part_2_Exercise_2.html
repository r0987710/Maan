    <h1>Hotlinking</h1>

    <h2>Hotlinking from Wikimedia servers</h2>

    <p>Hotlinking is allowed from Wikimedia servers, but not generally recommended: this is because anyone could change, vandalise, rename or delete a hotlinked image. On your own server, you will have control over what is served.</p>

    <p>If you do hotlink, then it is still necessary to follow the licensing conditions (see Commons:Reusing content outside Wikimedia) as you would for copies on your own server, including (if the license requires it) providing attribution as specified by the content creator. Ignoring the licenses could be a copyright infringement, regardless of whether you hotlink or use a copy of the file from your own server.</p>

    <p>Wikimedia generally does not allow 'hot spider' services, where each time someone performs a search on their site, the query is redirected to our site. Outside reusers should either copy the content one item at a time or contact the Foundation regarding a live feed.</p>

    <h2>How to avoid hotlinking</h2>

    <p>As a website user you should always try to avoid hotlinking assets from other websites. Doing so helps ensure that the original owner of the asset won't incur unnecessary charges and that the asset that you link to won't be unaccessible given that the owner implements hotlink protection or removes the asset. If you have found an image from another website and you would like to use it on your own website, you can upload the image directly to your server and deliver it from there. Doing this will also increase the delivery speed of the asset as the browser does not need to perform an additional DNS lookup. if you find an image that you want to link to but don't have a server to upload it to, you can use a third party host. An image hosting service for example will allow you to upload your image and link to it directly within your website or any other location.</p>
